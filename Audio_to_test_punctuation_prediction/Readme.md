OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT  
Dataset Collection:
The critical initial step involves sourcing data from NPTEL course transcripts and dedicated C programming books. This meticulously curated dataset enhances the contextual understanding of technical language, contributing significantly to the accuracy of punctuation predictions.

Audio-to-Text Transformation using Whisper ASR:
The project commences with converting spoken words into textual content using the Whisper ASR model. This foundational step sets the stage for subsequent processing, establishing a robust groundwork for accurate transcription.

Spell Checking with Spark NLP Contextual Corrector:
To address challenges like misinterpreted words, spelling errors, and extended pauses, we integrate a context-aware spell checker based on Spark NLP. This addition enhances transcription precision by considering the contextual nuances of the English language.

Transfer Learning with NPTEL Courses and C Programming Books Datasets:
Leveraging the context of technical content, transfer learning techniques are applied using datasets from NPTEL courses and C programming books. This step empowers the model to comprehend domain-specific intricacies, enhancing its accuracy in interpreting and transcribing technical language during live lectures.

BERT Model for Predictions:
The predictive capabilities of the model are further elevated with the incorporation of the NVIDIA BERT model. This advanced model utilizes contextual embeddings to refine the precision of punctuation predictions based on the audio and textual data context.

Dynamic Pipeline for Continuous Refinement:
A distinguishing feature of the project is its dynamic pipeline, designed for continuous refinement. This adaptability ensures the model remains responsive to evolving challenges during live lectures, accommodating varied speaking styles, technical jargon, and unexpected pauses.

Iterative Revision for Accuracy Enhancement:
Recognizing the dynamic nature of live lectures, the pipeline undergoes iterative revision. This involves revisiting and fine-tuning various components of the model to enhance accuracy continually. The iterative approach positions the project to address emerging challenges and adapt to evolving linguistic nuances effectively.
