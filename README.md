In this research we have considered different models and their implementation to 
derive differences among all the opinions of the individual based on the 
algorithms.We have first studied the dynamics of opinion formation under random 
interactions with a fixed rate of communication between pairs of agents.

We have studied voter model and its extensions to study the opinion based on neighbours with 
also considering opinion exchange processes inspired by the Sznajd model. We have 
described the structure of the social network statistically, assuming that the number of 
contacts of a given individual determines the probability that their opinion reaches 
and influences the opinion of another individual.

At the end, we have compared different graphs on the basis of the change in 
concentration of voters with positive opinion in each iteration. It further provided us 
with the judgement of identifying the most efficient algorithm among all.
Given the factual truth, we could guess which approach works best for the opinion 
shift dynamics of our network.
