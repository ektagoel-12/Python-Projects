# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze a large-scale dataset of over 1 million tweets. The objective is to perform sentiment classification by training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** 1,000,000+ tweets  
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and noise reduction  
- **Models Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes  
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 75% on sentiment classification  

## Key Highlights

- Applied advanced text preprocessing techniques for cleaning and normalization  
- Built and compared several ML models to identify the best performing classifier  
- Demonstrated real-world applicability in tracking public opinion and brand sentiment  
- Provided actionable insights for market research, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring  

## Technologies & Tools

- Python (Programming Language)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- NLTK / SpaCy (for NLP preprocessing)  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Load the tweet dataset  
4. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare data  
5. Train and evaluate the ML models  
6. Review performance metrics and visualize results
